# LEIC-PFL-Projects

This repository contains the **projects and exercises** developed for the **Functional and Logic Programming (PFL)** course in the 3rd year of the **Computer Engineering (LEIC)** degree.  
All assignments are implemented in **Haskell**, focusing on functional programming paradigms and logical reasoning.

## 🧠 Course topics

Some of the main concepts covered in this repository include:

- Functional programming principles (immutability, recursion, higher-order functions)
- Data types, pattern matching, and type inference
- List comprehensions and lazy evaluation
- Monads and functional I/O
- Logical reasoning and problem solving using Haskell

## 🚀 How to run the code

1. Make sure **GHC** (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and **GHCi** are installed.  
   You can check this with:
   ```bash
   ghc --version
   ghci --version
   ```

2. Compile a Haskell file (optional):
   ```bash
   ghc hello.hs -o hello
   ./hello
   ```

3. Or simply run it directly in the interactive interpreter:
   ```bash
   ghci hello.hs
   ```
